# metadata-extractor

###Setup
Assuming you have python3 and pip install, you should get up a virtualenv for this project. If don't have a prefered way to set that up run the following commands from the root directory of this project: 
```
python3 -m venv ./.venv/djangodev

source ./.venv/djangodev/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

THis will install django and sqlalchemy in a local venv.
